                Evil Hangman <br> <br>
                Evil Hangman is a hangman game written in C language. The key algorithms and data structure that were important for this program are dynamic arrays (vectors) and AVL trees. I have written many functions to build this program and have written unit tests as well. One of the important things I accomplished are building dynamic array objects using structs. By doing this assignment, I learned about how vectors and classes function in C++ as well as learned how to write a complex program with multiple files in C language.
