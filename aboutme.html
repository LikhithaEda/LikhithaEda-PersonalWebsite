                    Hi! My name is Likhitha. I am young professional in the tech industry. 
                    I am currently a technical account manager at Healthcare IT company called eClinicalwords.
                    I have experience in backend development, specifically in C, C++, Python.
                    I also have experience with DevOps, familiarity with frontend development, and experience with databases.
                    I have a passion for solving real world problems with technical solutions and curiosity to learn about new softwares.
                    I am quick learner, action oriented, and team player.
                    I spend my free time either working on small projects or trying new recipes!
